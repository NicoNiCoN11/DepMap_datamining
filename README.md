# DepMap_datamining

This resipository is used to save my code for data mining with DepMap

Before using these code you must download the data from https://depmap.org/portal/download/all/
please download these 4 files(they are too large that I can not upload them to my github)
1.CRISPRGeneEffect.csv (gene essenciality)
2.Model.csv(cancer type and cell line)
3.OmicsCNGene.csv(Copy number)
4.OmicsExpressionProteinCodingGenesTPMLogp1.csv(gene expression data)

please chek the path to these files

more codes will be uploaded here in the future as I learn more.
